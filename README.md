# IC_POeTISA_C4AI
Repository with code from my undergraduate research project, done under professors Dr. Norton Trevisan and Dr. Ariani di Felippo at the POeTISA lab of the Center for Artificial Intelligence (USP+IBM+FAPESP). Data was mostly provided by previous work at the POeTISA lab, or kindly provided by @bryankhelven as a result of his work on his masters thesis.
